                    <h3>Design and Developement</h3>
                    <p>"I began my coding journey with the dream of building my own company, and I saw programming as the first step toward that vision. Since then, I’ve developed a strong foundation in Web Development, Machine Learning, and Data Science, along with a solid grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms. Through continuous learning and hands-on practice, I’ve gained valuable experience in designing and developing impactful tech solutions."

                            <p>"Web development has always fascinated me — the ability to create something interactive and meaningful from just lines of code is what drew me in. I’ve since explored how structure, style, and logic come together to build seamless digital experiences. Whether it’s crafting clean user interfaces or writing efficient backend logic, I enjoy the process of bringing websites to life."

                        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
                        <p>"My interest in Machine Learning stems from a curiosity about how machines can learn and make decisions like humans. I’m fascinated by the way data, math, and code intersect to solve real-world problems — from predictions to pattern recognition. I’ve explored core ML concepts, worked with algorithms, and built models that learn from data, and I’m excited to keep pushing the boundaries of what’s possible through intelligent systems."

Diving into DSA has helped me develop strong problem-solving skills and a deeper understanding of how software works under the hood. From optimizing code performance to tackling complex logic, I enjoy the challenge of breaking down problems and building solutions that are both fast and scalable."
